# The Phone Ban Catalog

This repository catalogs publicly available information on Texas school district phone policies, including those in major cities, along with notes on policy wording.

While this catalog currently focuses on Texas, it is structured to support entries for other states if needed.  
If contributing information for another state, please create a new state-level directory, then add your city and district folders accordingly. <3
